      <h1>In Moringa School</h1>
      <p>The classroom seemed really small and quiet incapable of offering the skills that i am now bequethed with.But how wrong could one be.Moringa school is not an ordinary School,it is a school that will humble you as well as make you strive to achieve more than you could ever fathom.</p>

      <h1>The Journey</h1>
      <p>Everyday had its unique way of challenging the dark corners of your brain.those cells that have long not been used.You could see that the staff there saw the twinkle in the eye of young minds ready to learn and absorb all that was giving in an exponetial manner.</p>
